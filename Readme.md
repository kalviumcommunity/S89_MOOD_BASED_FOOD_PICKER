## Project Title: "Mood-Based Food Picker"

## Project Overview:
The "Mood-Based Food Picker" is an application which assists users in choosing food depending on their existing mood. Upon entering their mood, the app recommends the ideal meal to accompany it, if they feel happy, stressed, adventurous, or even lazy. The intention is to make meal planning easy and give users foods that suit their moods, thereby making meal time more enjoyable.

## Key Features:
1.Mood Input System: The user can select from pre-set moods (e.g., happy, sad, angry, tired, etc.), or define their own.
2.Food Recommendations: The app recommends a food or meal based on the mood input. Customizable Meal Options: Users can select food options based on dietary choice (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free, spicy, etc.).
3.Meal Rating System: Once a meal is tried, users are able to rate how much their mood was matched by the meal, refining future suggestions.
4.Recipe Sharing: Users are able to share their food and mood combinations and recipes with other community members.

## Tech Stack:
1.Frontend: React (for developing a dynamic and responsive user interface).
2.Backend: Node.js with Express (for processing user data, mood input, and meal suggestion). 
3.Database: MongoDB (to store user profiles, mood history, and meal information). 
4.APIs: Edamam API or Spoonacular API (in case of suggesting food recipes). Mood-Tracking API (for the enhancement of mood-based input, if implemented). 
5.Authentication: Firebase Authentication (for managing user accounts). Cloud Storage: Firebase or AWS (for uploading user-generated content, like pictures or recipes).

## Why This Project:
I chose this project because it combines two of my favorite things—food and emotions! It’s a fun way to experiment with mood-based algorithms and food data. By working on this, 
I’ll get to: 
Improve my skills in frontend development (React) and backend (Node.js). Explore API integrations (for recipe suggestions). Design a user-friendly and interactive system that combines emotions with food choices. Learn how to manage user data, ratings, and content sharing.

## Conclusion
The mix of frontend (React) and backend (Node.js) development will give you solid full-stack experience, while working with APIs like Spoonacular or Edamam will help you dive deeper into API integration. You’ll also learn how to handle databases efficiently with MongoDB and manage user authentication with Firebase.
